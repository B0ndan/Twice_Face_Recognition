🌐 How to Use <br/>
To integrate our model into your project, follow these simple steps: <br/>
1. Download the model using the [provided link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XYwe0s_CxWdUpujz5Wb38iqiz_WR6Q38/view?usp=sharing).
2. **Download or Clone the Repository**:
   Start by downloading the repository using the following command or by cloning it:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   ```
4. Install Dependencies:
   Navigate to the project directory and install the required libraries mentioned in requirements.txt:
   ```bash
   cd your-repository
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
6. Run Webcam App or Image Input App:
   If you want to experience the real-time power of our model with a webcam feed, run the following command:
  ```bash
  python Twice_streamlit_webcam_app.py
  ```
   This will launch the webcam app, showcasing the model's capabilities on live video input.
   If you prefer using static images as input, you can run the image input app with the following command:
  ```bash
  python streamlit_image.py
  ```
   This will allow you to input image data and observe the model's predictions. <br/>

Feel free to customize the apps according to your needs, and don't hesitate to explore the codebase. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

Happy experimenting! 🚀
